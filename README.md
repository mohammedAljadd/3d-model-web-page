## 🏠 3D Model

The house model used in this project is based on the [**Civitas Modular House 3x3 LV1-001**](https://grabcad.com/library/civitas-modular-house-3x3-lv1-001-1) from GrabCAD.


### 🔧 Pre-processing in Blender

Before importing into Three.js, the model was optimized and modified in Blender to improve performance and interactivity:

- **Separate Doors** – The original model treated all doors as a single object. They were separated into individual objects to enable proper opening and closing animations.

- **UV Mapping for Textures** – Applied UV mapping to walls, doors, and the roof to ensure textures display correctly in the 3D scene.

- **Rescaling** – The model was very large in Three.js coordinates, so it was scaled down by 0.001 in Blender. (This scaling could also be done directly in Three.js if preferred.)

- **Format Conversion** – Instead of working with 24 separate .obj files, the model was combined and exported as a single .glTF file for better loading performance and easier asset management.
